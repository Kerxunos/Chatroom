*LOG SYSTEM*
you can find the log file in the program path or file
if you are the server your log file name is will be: Server_INFO.log
if you are the client your log file name is will be: Client_INFO.log
server cant acces client's log file 
server and client is can accces only own log files
your IP Address, Messages(including client's messages), Client's IP Address(if you use), etc. in the server's log file
your IP Address, Messages(includin Server's messages), etc. in the client's log file

__-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------__

*SERVER*
server is important because server is binds the connection
server has special commands like /client_ip, /kick, /shutdown etc.
server can be see the client's IP Adrress I add this feature because i worried about the unknown connections, if you doubt about the connection you can identify the connection with this feature

__-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------__

*SERVER COMMANDS*
- /client_ip: server uses this command to see the client's IP Address (but this a new feature it can be buggy)
- /kick: server uses this command to kick the client (you must restart the application but we will fix that bug)
- /shutdown: server uses this command for turn off the application and connection
- /clear: server uses this command for clear the text (but this command is NOT delete the log)
we will add new commands...

__-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------__

*CLIENT*
client is depend on the server
first server binds the connection then client is connects the server
client is can just chatting and connecting the server
but we will add new features to client dont worry
